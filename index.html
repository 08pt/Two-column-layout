      <p>Forecasting about the Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic involves high uncertainty and may be affected by 
        measures taken by the government to fight the disease. This research explores machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast 
        the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in India. We used 22 ML algorithms develop forecasting models and selected the four 
        best ones on the basis of their performance using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Feature extraction and feature 
        selection techniques were also employed to improve performance with cumulative and daily data obtained from Mar. 2 to Apr. 
        25, 2020. Because of the linear nature of cumulative data, the model built with these time series data outperforms with an
         MAPE of 0.498, 0.240, and 0.430, respectively, for cases that are confirmed or recovered and deaths using 
        the extra tree regressor compared with the model built with daily data with an MAPE of 1.377, 1.302, and 0.488,
         respectively.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p><strong>The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</strong> has been declared a world pandemic threat by the World Health 
      Organization and is spreading rapidly across the world. It is an infectious disease caused by a virus called 
      a novel coronavirus, which was also the reason for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. 
      The SARS epidemic [1,2] was predicted by many authors using various machine learning (ML) techniques. 
      Because of COVID-19, the number of confirmed cases and deaths are rapidly increasing in all most all countries; 
      India has not escaped this pandemic. The first case of COVID-19 emerged in India on Jan. 30, 2020; 2 more cases 
      were found on Feb. 3, 2020 and the number was stable until Mar. 1, 2020. The disease has since spread to most states 
      and cities of India [3]. Few states or cities remain untouched by the COVID-19 outbreak in India. There is no vaccine 
      to treat COVID-19 to prevent infection from one infected person to another. India has learned a lesson from other countries, 
      and therefore the Indian government has made appropriate decisions and implemented various strategies to prevent the pandemic
      from spreading across the country well in advance. Many approaches were taken to stop spreading cases of COVID-19 from 
      affected to unaffected parts of the country, including a citywide lockdown, closing all transports such as airports,
      railways, and local transportations, and closing markets, malls, cinemas, productions, and so on. Moreover,
      the isolation or quarantine of suspected patients is being done. The entire machinery of the government
      is fully involved to stop spreading it in the community; despite this, cases of COVID-19 positive are 
      increasing every day. By the time of writing, there were more than 26,283 confirmed cases in India,
      825 of whom died and about 5938 of whom had recovered, and the numbers keep rising.</p>
